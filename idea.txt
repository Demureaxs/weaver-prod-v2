when we provide like refinement we can also pass the prev and next paragraphs for context plus the chars model
models for long form context from summary of the entire story arc across chapters (these can be x chapters long enough to write a full fiction novel)
Each chapter also has a summary.
each chapters summary is what makes up its paragraphs
when refining paragraphs, it will use the prev and next paragraphs plus the character context of whos involved (these will be selectable from the character list)
character list includes things like age, bio, gender, job history, any wild and wonderful information that could influence the outcome of the models refinement prompt.
books should be related to users (user can have many books)
characters, summary, chapters, story type are all related to abook(a book can have multiple characters, chapters, and one summary and one story type (romance, horror etc))
